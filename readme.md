# Express js with Postman testing and using nodemon 

Step 1 - Import Express: import express from 'express';

    Think Express as a chef, you're saying Come help me cook up a web server, so basically it's a toolbox kinda thing.


Step 2 - Create an Express App

    const app = express();

Step 3 - Set the Port Number:

    This is like choosing door (port) your server will open on.

Step 4 - Create the homepage route 

    When someone comes to your website's main page, you send them a friendly message 

Step 5 - Create Another route 

    If someone types /expressserver after your website's address, you show them this message.

step 6 - Create Another Route

    If someone visits your websites and goes to /instagram, you show them "LazyRitzz" which is my insta id, follow if you like it 

Step 7 - Start the server 

    I am telling the website to start running and listen for visitors on door number 8000


*nodemon*

    Nodemon is a tool that helps automatically restart your server Node.js server whenever you make changes to your code.

    It's like a automatic referesh button for your server.
his is about postman:

Postman is a popular API (application programme Interface) developement and testing tool used primariry by developers, testers and devOps engineers.


It's a collaborative platform that provides a user friendly interface to send HTTP requests snd inspect responses, without writing code manually. It supports various request types such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.


Why Postman is used ??

    Its used for API testing such as RESTful APIs that verify that endpoints returns the expected results.

    It is helpful for both manual and automated API testing.


Sending HTTP Requests:

    You can send different types of HTTP requests and pass parameters, headers, body, and authorization easily.

Inspecting Responses:

    Shows the status code, headers, cookies, and body of the response in a readable format (JSON, HTML, XML).

Automation:

    Enables scripting (using JavaScript) for tests and pre-request setups.

    You can write test scripts to validate response data, headers, status codes, etc.

Mock Servers:

    Simulate server responses for front-end developers to continue development without depending on the actual backend.

Collaboration:

    Teams can share collections, environments, and documentation easily using Postman Workspaces.

Environment Variables:

    Useful for testing APIs in different environments like development, staging, and production without changing the core request.

Documentation:

    Postman can auto-generate API documentation from your collections.
